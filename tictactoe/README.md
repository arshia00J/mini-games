# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with MiniMax Algorithm
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python utilizing the MiniMax algorithm for the AI player. The game allows a player to play against an AI opponent that employs the MiniMax algorithm to make optimal moves.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arshia00J/tictactoe.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:


```bash
cd tictactoe
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
python runner.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How to Play
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If the grid is filled without any player achieving a win, the game ends in a draw.

## AI Implementation
The AI opponent in this game uses the MiniMax algorithm to make its moves. MiniMax is a decision rule used in decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. In the context of this game, MiniMax allows the AI to choose the best possible move based on the current state of the game.
